                        <h2>Our Purpose.</h2>
                        <p>
                            The whole idea behind this conference is to unite and bring under one-roof youths from different parts of India. Youths who speak different languages, youths facing diverse challenges, ideas and visions that are totally different and ways to just get
                            each one more closer to God. The whole program is planned in such a way that youngsters do not find it as a session or lecture series, but rather, a life lesson and so the topics are chosen according to the current life realities
                            of young people. A relevant theme is chosen every time, that is central in all discussions. All participants are divided into groups of 30-35 each comprising directors, animators and youth and provoked into discussions by a
                            specialized moderator, by answering a set of given questions based on the theme. In this they spend 3 hours every day and deliberate on realities of young people today, their faith, aspirations, hopes and what role can the
                            church play in their lives. The discussions of this segment are compiled into what we have as the statement of the conference in order for the church in India to listen to the youth and ponder over their thoughts.</p>

                    The theme selected for the convention “Touched by Jesus, Walking His way” is very apt as the Universal Church observes this year as the ‘Year of Mercy’. I wish the convention all the very best and with all the sessions, workshops, thematic discussions,
                    strategic plans and exhibitions, I hope that it will be a unique experience to all the youth giving them exposure into various aspects of life and expectations.
